 0. Introduction
 ===============

 0.1 Comments
 ------------

 Comments are allowed in the submitted challenge:
 - Multiple lines comments between /* and * / (without the space between * and /)
 - Single line comment starting with //
 
 Comments are automatically suppressed during the correction step.

 0.2 Answers
 -----------

 The lines that do not contain a comment are considered as an answer. Here is an example. If the
question is: "What is the color of Napoleon white’s horse?" 1 , the template will indicate the number of
the question and the expected format (between brackets):

0.2 [1 word, small case characters]
*/



/*
 As it can be seen, one just has to write "white" (do not forget to actually write
 the answer). Blank lines may be added. It is recommended to be case insensitive
 during the correction.
 
 0.3 Answer separator
 --------------------
 
 Each answer is separated by a "#". To not answer a question, one just has to left
 it blank. A blank answer must be at least one white-space character (e.g. a
 newline one).

 1 Russian peasant multiplication

 Here is the way to represent the Russian peasan multiplication:

 Separate the columns with the '|' symbol.
 Separate the rows with a newline character.

 There are 4 columns: multiplicand, multiplier, remainder and partial sum.
 Do not add title to the columns but respect their respective order. Write a
 number in each cell of the array, not a computation.
 
 Example for 68 * 123. here is the expected array: 
 
  123 | 68 | 0 |    0
  246 | 34 | 0 |    0
  492 | 17 | 1 |  492
  984 |  8 | 0 |  492
 1968 |  4 | 0 |  492
 3936 |  2 | 0 |  492
 7872 |  1 | 1 | 8364
